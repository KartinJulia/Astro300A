    "The first parameter of an orbit is the _semi-major axis_, often denoted $a$.  This can be thought of as the radius of an orbit at its most distant point. Specifically, the semi-major axis is half the major axis of an ellipse, which is shown by the red line labeled $a$ in the figure below. The semi-major axis is related to the period, as we learned in the transit activity.  The semi-major axis can have any value from $0$ to $\\infty$.\n",

    "As a note, a star will always be in one of the _foci_ of the orbits (in the image, denoted F1 and F2).  So, if the ellipse below were an orbit and the star was at F1, the planet would be much closer to the star when it is on the left part of its orbit (called _pericenter_, literally close to center) than when it is on the right (called _apocenter_, literally far from center).\n",

An inclination of $90^{\\circ}$ means that the orbit is polar, or exactly perpendicular to, the orbit plane.
